### What I learned

I learnt how to use flexbox effectively. Though this is a newbie challege it gave me good insights about the concept.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - I referred to tailwind docs for almost everything I used that was related to CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
